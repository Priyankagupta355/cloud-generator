## 🛠 How It Works
1. Users input parameters like cloud density, shape, and size.  
2. Procedural algorithms generate cloud textures or patterns based on these inputs.  
3. Clouds are rendered in real-time or saved as images for use in projects.  
4. Optional features include animation and dynamic weather effects.
